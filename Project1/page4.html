            <ol>
                <li> <span>On February 10, 2013</span>, a stampede broke out at the Allahabad railway station due to overcrowding.</li>
                <li>Happened on <span>Mauni Amavasya</span>, one of the most auspicious bathing days of the festival</li>
                <li>Casualties: At least <span>36</span> people were killed.</li>
                 <li>Injuries: Over <span>30</span> people were injured.</li>   
                <li>Cause: The stampede reportedly started due to a rush on a footbridge at the station, triggered by
                    <span>overcrowding</span>. Some reports suggested that a railing collapsed, leading to panic. </li>
                <li> Response: Emergency services struggled to manage the situation due to the massive crowd. Authorities
                    later <span>faced criticism for inadequate crowd control measures.</span></li>

            <ol>
            <li><span>On January 29th 2025</span></li>
             <li> <span>38</span> fatal injuries while many more people suffered serious wounds.</li> 
             <li>Thousands of pilgrims gathered at the <span>Triveni Sangam</span> to bathe on one of the
                most spiritual bathing days when the stampede happened.</li>   
             <li>Cause:Reports show <span>overcrowding combined with too few entryways</span> when thousands of devotees entered together as the
                primary causes of the tragedy. The deployed security personnel and crowd management
                efforts failed to contain the vast number of pilgrims following their deployment.</li>   
             <li>Response:The incident pushed authorities to evaluate their crowd management procedures
                because it exposed serious safety concerns. Religious leaders have requested pilgrims
                to be vigilant concerning their presence at the shrine and the government has started a
                <span>judicial investigation</span> to determine why the stampede occurred. </li>
