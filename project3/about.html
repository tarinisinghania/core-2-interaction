    <p>The website is designed as a digital sanctuary for college students in New York,
         offering them a much-needed breather from academic stress through thoughtfully

         "Touch grass" is a popular internet slang term meaning to spend time outdoors and disconnect from online activities.
         This site invites users to explore personalized trips within, around, and outside the city—from 
         tranquil corners in local parks and hidden fun spots to scenic day trips and nature
          escapes just a train ride away. With its calming visuals and intuitive navigation, 
          the platform encourages students to disconnect from their screens and reconnect with 
          themselves, their surroundings, and a slower pace of life—reminding them that rest is 
          not a luxury, but a vital part of well-being. <br>
